          <li>
            <strong>1998</strong> - Gerrard made his Liverpool first-team debut
            on 29 November in a Premier League match against Blackburn Rovers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1999–2000</strong> - Gerrard began to regularly partner
            Redknapp in central midfield. After starting the derby against
            Everton on the bench, he replaced Robbie Fowler in the second half
            but received his first career red card. Later that season, Gerrard
            scored his first senior goal in a 4–1 victory over Sheffield
            Wednesday.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2000–01</strong> - He made fifty starts in all competitions
            and scored ten goals as he won his first major honours with
            Liverpool – the FA Cup, Football League Cup, and the UEFA Cup. He
            was named PFA Young Player of the Year by his peers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2002-2003</strong> - In the following season, he would go on
            to win both the FA Charity Shield and UEFA Super Cup. In March 2003,
            Gerrard scored the opening goal in the club's 2–0 win over
            Manchester United in the Football League Cup Final.
          </li>

            Liverpool came back from a three-goal deficit to tie the match at
            3–3 after extra time, with Gerrard scoring one of the goals. Dubbed
            the Miracle of Istanbul, the match is widely regarded as one of the
            greatest finals in the competition's history, and Gerrard was lauded
            as the catalyst for the second half comeback. Gerrard was named the
            Man of the Match, and later received the UEFA Club Footballer of the
            Year award.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2006-2007</strong> - Gerrard scored 23 goals in 53
            appearances in 2005–06, and in April became the first Liverpool
            player since John Barnes in 1988 to be voted the PFA Player of the
            Year. He scored twice in the 2006 FA Cup Final against West Ham
            United, including a 35-yard equaliser that sent the match into extra
            time, and Liverpool won their second consecutive major trophy on
            penalties. The goals made him the only player to have scored in the
            FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Cup and Champions League finals.

            player, he was usually deployed as a central midfielder, but he had
            also been used as a second striker, a holding midfielder, an
            attacking midfielder, a right back, and a right winger. He made 710
            appearances for Liverpool, scoring 186 goals.
